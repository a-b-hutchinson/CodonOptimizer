# CodonOptimizer

Searches [UniprotKB](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb) entries and matches the canonical isoform with NCBI accession IDs based on amino sequence. Ultimately translates cDNA into optimized E. Coli codon.

Program takes csv input with a column labeled "uniprot_id" and a UniprotKB entry value (e.g. P05089)

# EnzymeSelector

Notebook used to select a common enzyme to remove from optimized codon.
